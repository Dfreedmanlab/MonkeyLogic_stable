The NIMH-Daqtoolbox is now compatible with Windows 7, 8 and 10

I am including multiple releases of the toolbox, organized by date, in case you have issues with the latest version.

Unzip the included file and add the folder to your matlab path (before adding the other MonkeyLogic directories to the PATH). 
More detailed instructions are contained within the zip file.
