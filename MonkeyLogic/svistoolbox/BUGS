Version 1.2

	When you call "Matlab -nojvm" from the Cygwin command line, there
	seems to be interaction between Cygwin and Matlab that causes
	keystrokes to show up on the Matlab command line.

	If you call Matlab from a shortcut, the problem goes away.  It may
	be that Cygwin installs KbdHook's that interfere with the KBD
	library's KbdHook.
